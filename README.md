# Nuxt 3 Jaden Chant

Using [Nuxt3](https://nuxt.com/), [MongoDB/MongooseDB](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/), [Auto Health Export](https://www.healthexportapp.com/), [Tres.js](https://tresjs.org/), [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Dev environment

To run dev use the command `npx nuxi dev` or `npm run dev`

Config is the biggest pain of Nuxt.js, none of the Nuxt Modules seem to work together. 
Had to wait for the Nuxt Image and Tres.js Modules to upgrade in order to use them. 
Can't use Pinia with this version of Nuxt anyways.
Documentation of Nuxt is atrocious, not a single useful example.
Small community of developers, not as much support.

## Deployment

Autodeploy to Google Cloud Run

Remember .env variables

## Node Environment Notes

Nuxt version 3.3 (NEED `node v18.15.0`)

Previous Nuxt version 3.0 worked with any `node v16.14.2`

## ToDo List
[] Fix moblie 30 day health data
[] Add flower 3D renderings

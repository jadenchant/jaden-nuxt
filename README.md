# Nuxt 3 Jaden Chant

Using [Nuxt3](https://nuxt.com/), [MongoDB/MongooseDB](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/), [Health Auto Export](https://www.healthexportapp.com/), [Tres.js](https://tresjs.org/), [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Dev environment

To run dev use the command `npx nuxi dev` or `npm run dev`

Config is the biggest pain of Nuxt.js, none of the Nuxt Modules seem to work together.
Had to wait for the Nuxt Image and Tres.js Modules to upgrade in order to use them.
Can't use Pinia with this version of Nuxt anyways.
Documentation of Nuxt is atrocious, not a single useful example.
Small community of developers, not as much support.

## Deployment

Remember .env variables
